# Work Break timer

## A python GUI app that helps you time the work and break periods.

This app was build using the Python module Tkinter. In this app users can:
* Start a timer that counts the following:
1. Work period for 25 minutes
2. Break period for 5 minutes
3. Work period for 25 minutes
4. Break period for 5 minutes
5. Work period for 25 minutes
6. Break period for 5 minutes
7. Work period for 25 minutes
8. Long break period for 5 minutes

* Reset the timer

After every work period counted a green âœ” is added at the bottom of the screen.
The long break period is differentiated from the regular break period by the color of the displayed text. During the regular break period the text is displayed in a pink color, as opposed to the long break period during which the text is displayed in a red color.
